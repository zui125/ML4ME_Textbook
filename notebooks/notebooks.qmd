# In-Class Notebooks {.unnumbered}

This is a list of some of the in-class notebooks I have created for my course, elements of which are already part of the book. I am listing the individual notebooks here to have a direct link to download individual notebooks, since we often use these in class and it is helpful to have them in a centralized place with download links:

- Reviewing Data Visualization: [California Housing Dataset](california_housing_visualization.ipynb)
- [Introduction to Linear Regression and Cross-Validation](cross_validation_linear_regression.ipynb)
- [Introduction to Gradient Descent](supervised_linear_models.ipynb)
- [Loss Functions for Linear Models](loss_functions_for_linear_models.ipynb)
